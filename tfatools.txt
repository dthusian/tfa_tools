rfc: modular tools, electric glue

concept
- can modularize a tool/sword/armor, which replaces enchantments with modules which can be inserted or removed from tools easily
- modularized tools automatically have mending unbreaking 3 which is offset by the cost of modularizing (unspecified right now)
- tools have maximum module slots depending on material, 1 module takes up 1 slot
- modules are found in chest loot with a random strength from 1.0 to 1.5, certain structures are biased towards certain module types (e.g. mineshaft has more efficiency  modules)
- 1.0 = 1 level of an enchantment
- binary modules are either on/off, no strength associated with it

data
- tool slots
  - netherite: 7
  - diamond: 6
  - gold: 9
  - iron: 6
  - copper: 3
- sword slots: todo
- armor slots:
  - netherite: 4
  - diamond: 3
  - gold: 5
  - iron: 3
  - copper: 2

tool enchants
- fortune: includes both fortune and looting, cap = 3
- efficiency: no cap
- silk touch: binary. costs 2 slots
- durability: binary. decreases chance for durability to be used by 5% additive. combined with the free unbr3 (75% chance not to be used) 5 durability = unbreakable tool
- sharpness: cap = 5
- flintslate: binary. reworked fire aspect, turns sword damage type to fire. adds +1 to sharp cap
- knockback: cap = 2

armor enchants
- blade prot, blunt prot, fire prot, blast prot, proj prot, magic prot: 2 epf/lv
- featherfall: 3 epf/lv
- aqua affinity: binary. head: aqua affinity and resp 3, boots: depth strider 3
- soul speed: binary.
- swift sneak: binary.
- frost walker: binary.
- 18 epf cap per prot

balancing justification 
- netherite/diamond tool slots were balanced around making them a bit more powerful than a maxed enchant pick
- in order to give weaker materials situational use, they have been given unique abilities
  - gold: significantly more slots
  - copper: enchantment caps do not apply
  - iron: +0.3 to module strength (limit 1.5 per module)
- the most powerful interactions possible with this
  - unbreakable efficiency 6 gold tool
  - fortune/looting 4.5 copper tool
  - 5 slots + 2 piece copper armor on a certain prot = immunity to that damage class
- efficiency >5 does not matter that much unless it allows instant mining, since without instamine you are limited to 1 block / 4gt and max efficiency netherite is close to that for most materials

unsolved mysteries
- sword slot counts?
- slot usage for qol armor enchants?
  - protection uses the epf 18 cap
  - due to small number of slots, would be bad if using these enchants took away slots for prot
- thorns?
  - likely will never see use due to taking up protection slots (make separate slots?)
